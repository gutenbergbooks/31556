<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>DICK'S DADDY.</h3>

<p>etween Fox Peak and Smoke Creek
Desert, on the western edge of the State
of Nevada, is a beautiful valley, carpeted
with bunch grass, which looks particularly
bright and green to the venturesome traveller
who has just crossed either of the two deserts lying
toward the east.</p>

<p>"Buffalo Meadows" the Indians named it, because
of the vast herds of American bison found
there before the white men hunted simply for the
sport of killing; but those who halt at the last
watercourse prior to crossing the wide stretches
of sand on the journey east, speak of it as "Comfort
Hollow."</p>

<p>To a travel-stained party who halted at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
water-pool nearest the desert on a certain afternoon
in September two years ago, this last name
seemed particularly appropriate.</p>

<p>They had come neither for gold nor the sport of
hunting; but were wearily retracing their steps,
after having wandered and suffered among the
foot-hills of the Sierras in a fruitless search for a
home, on which they had been lured by unscrupulous
speculators.</p>

<p>Nearly two years previous Richard Stevens&mdash;"Roving
Dick" his acquaintances called him&mdash;had
first crossed the vast plain of sand, with his wife,
son, and daughter.</p>

<p>His entire worldly possessions consisted of a
small assortment of household goods packed in
a stout, long-bodied wagon, covered with canvas
stretched over five poles bent in a half-circle, and
drawn by two decrepit horses.</p>

<p>The journey had been a failure, so far as finding
a home in the wilds was concerned, where the head
of the family could live without much labor; and
now the homeless ones, decidedly the worse for
wear, were returning to Willow Point, on the Little
Humboldt River.</p>

<p>The provisions had long since been exhausted;
the wagon rudely repaired in many places; the
cooking utensils were reduced to one pot and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
battered dipper; the canvas covering was torn and
decaying, and the horses presented a skeleton-like
appearance.</p>

<p>The family had suffered outwardly quite as
much as the goods. Young Dick and his father
wore clothing which had been patched and repatched
with anything Mrs. Stevens could push a
needle through, until it would have been impossible
to say what was the original material; but to
a boy thirteen years of age this seemed a matter
of little consequence, while his father preferred
such a costume rather than exert himself to tan
deer-hides for one more serviceable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevens and six-year-old Margie were in a
less forlorn condition as to garments; but they also
needed a new outfit sadly, and nearly every day
young Dick told them confidentially that he would
attend to the matter immediately after arriving at
Willow Point, even if it became necessary for him
to sell his rifle, the only article of value he owned.</p>

<p>"Once across the desert, mother," he said, as the
sorry-looking team was drawn up by the side of
the pool, and he began to unharness the horses
while his father went in search of game for supper,
"and then we shall be well on our way to the old
home we had no business to leave."</p>

<p>"It is this portion of the journey that worries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
me most, Dick. You remember what a hard time
we had when the animals were in good condition;
and now that they are hardly able to drag their
own bones along, the danger is great."</p>

<p>"No more than when we crossed the river; and
even though father did feel afraid there, we got
along all right," was the cheerful reply. "There
should be plenty of game here, and after a square
feed things won't look so bad."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevens turned wearily away to make preparations
for the evening meal in case the hunter
should bring in a supply of meat, but made no
reply. She understood why young Dick spoke
encouragingly, and felt proud that the boy displayed
so much tenderness for her; yet the fact
could not be disguised that dangers beset the little
party on every hand.</p>

<p>It required but a small amount of labor in order
to make ready for the night.</p>

<p>Tired as the horses were, there was no likelihood
of their straying very far; and Dick simply removed
the harness, allowing the animals to roam
at will. The wagon served as a camp; and the
most arduous task was that of gathering materials
with which to make a fire, when nothing larger
than a bush could be seen on either hand.</p>

<p>Then there was no more to be done save await<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the return of the hunter, and it was not until the
shadows began to lengthen into the gloom of night
that young Dick felt seriously alarmed.</p>

<p>He knew his father would not have gone very
far from the camp in search of game, because he
was on foot, and there was no more promising
place for sport than within the radius of a mile
from where they had halted. Besides, when hunting
took the form of labor which must be performed,
Richard Stevens was not one who would
continue it long, unless he was remarkably hungry.</p>

<p>Young Dick's mother gave words to her anxiety
several times; but the boy argued with her that no
harm could have befallen the absent one in that
vicinity, and for a time her fears were allayed.</p>

<p>When another hour passed, however, and nothing
was heard from his father, even Dick lost courage,
and believed that the culminating point in
their troubles had been reached.</p>

<p>His mother and Margie had entered the wagon
when night was fully come, knowing they must go
supperless to bed unless the hunter returned; and
to Dick the thought that these two whom he loved
so dearly were hungry, brought him almost as much
sorrow as the unaccountable absence of his father.</p>

<p>He believed, however, that it was his duty to
appear unconcerned, as if confident his father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
prolonged absence did not betoken danger. He
trudged to and fro in the immediate vicinity of the
vehicle, at times whistling cheerily to show there
was no trouble on his mind; and again, when it
was impossible to continue the melody because of
the sorrow in his heart, repeated to his mother
that nothing serious could have befallen the absent
one, that probably he had unconsciously wandered
a long distance from the camp on the trail of game.</p>

<p>"It don't stand to reason he will try to make
his way now it is dark, mother dear; but within
an hour or two after sunrise he'll be here, and the
breakfast we shall then have will make up for the
loss of supper."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevens made no reply; and listening a
moment, Dick heard the sound of suppressed sobs.</p>

<p>His mother was in distress, and he could do no
more toward comforting her than repeat what he
did not absolutely believe.</p>

<p>He knew full well that unless some accident had
befallen him, his father would have returned before
dark; that he would not have allowed himself to
be led so far away from the camping-place that he
could not readily return; and the boy's sorrow was
all the greater because it was impossible to console
his mother.</p>

<p>Clambering into the wagon, he put his arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
around her neck, pressing his cheek close against
hers, and during what seemed a very long while
the two remained silent, not daring to give words
to their fears.</p>

<p>Then Dick bethought himself of a plan which
offered some slight degree of hope, and starting up
suddenly, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I ought to have done it before, an' it ain't too
late now."</p>

<p>"Done what, Dick dear?"</p>

<p>"Gone out in the direction father took, and fired
the rifle two or three times. It may be he has lost
his bearings, and the report of the gun would be
enough to let him know where we are."</p>

<p>"But you must not go now that it is dark, my
boy. Suppose you should lose your way? Then
what would become of Margie and me?"</p>

<p>"There's no danger of that, mother. I've been
in the woods often enough to be able to take care
of myself, surely."</p>

<p>"Your father would have said the same thing
when he set out; but yet we know some accident
must have befallen him."</p>

<p>"Let me go only a little way, mother."</p>

<p>"Of what avail would that be, my son? If the
purpose is to discharge your rifle, hoping father
may hear the report, why not do it here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>"I will, if you won't let me go farther."</p>

<p>"I can't, Dick dear. I might be braver under
other circumstances, but now the thought of your
leaving me is more than I can bear."</p>

<p>"I won't go so far but that I can see the
wagon," Dick said, kissing his mother and little
Margie much as though bidding them good-by;
and a few moments later the report of his rifle
almost startled the occupants of the wagon.</p>

<p>During the next hour Dick discharged his weapon
at least twelve times, but there was no reply of
whatsoever nature.</p>

<p>If his father was alive and within hearing, he was
too badly disabled to give token of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>The supply of cartridges was not so large that
very many could be used without making a serious
inroad upon the store; and realizing the uselessness
of further efforts in this direction, Dick went
back to the wagon.</p>

<p>Margie had fallen asleep, her head pillowed in
her mother's lap; and Mrs. Stevens, unwilling to
disturb the child, was taking such rest as was possible
while she leaned against the canvas covering
of the wagon.</p>

<p>Dick seated himself beside her. It was not necessary
he should speak of his failure, for she knew
that already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>He had thought it his duty to join her for a few
moments, and then go outside again to act the part
of sentinel, although such labor could be of little
avail; but before he had been nestling by her side
five minutes his eyes were closed in slumber; and
the mother, her mind reaching out to the absent
father, spent the hours of the night in wakefulness,
watching over her children.</p>

<p>The sun had risen before Dick's eyes were opened;
and springing to his feet quickly, ashamed of having
slept while his mother kept guard, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to hang on here like a baby while
you were awake, mother, but my eyes shut before
I knew it."</p>

<p>"It is well you rested, my son. Nothing could
have been done had you remained awake."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but I should have felt better, because
if anything has happened to father, though I
don't say it can be possible, I'm the one who must
take care of you and Margie."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevens kissed the boy, not daring to trust
herself to speak; and he hurried out, for there was
before him a full day's work, if he would do that
which he had decided upon in his mind the evening
previous.</p>

<p>There was no reasonable hope any one would
come that way for many days&mdash;perhaps months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>They were alone, and whatever was done must
be accomplished by this thirteen-year-old boy.</p>

<p>"I'm going after something for breakfast, mother,
and then count on trying to follow father's trail,"
Dick said, after looking around in every direction,
even though he knew there was no possibility of
seeing any human being.</p>

<p>"There is no reason why you should spend the
time in trying to get food for us, Dick dear. Margie
and I can get on very well without breakfast,
and you will have the more time to hunt for your
father; but remember, my boy, that you are the
only one we can depend upon now, and without you
we might remain here until we starved."</p>

<p>"I'll take good care not to go so far from the
wagon but that I can find my way back; for surely
I'll be able to follow on my own trail, if there's no
other. Hadn't I better do a little hunting first?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you are very, very hungry, Dick.
Food would choke me just now, and there is enough
of the bread we baked yesterday morning to give
you and Margie an apology for a breakfast."</p>

<p>"I can get along without; you shall eat my
share. Now, don't worry if I'm not back until near
sunset. The horses are close at hand, and you may
be certain they won't stray while the feed is plentiful.
Stay in the wagon, even though there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to harm you if you walk around. We must be
careful that no more trouble comes upon us; so
keep under cover, mother dear, and I'll be here
again before night comes."</p>

<p>Dick was not as confident he could follow his
father's trail as he would have it appear to his
mother; but he decided upon the direction in which
he would search, and set bravely out heading due
west, knowing he could hold such a course by aid
of the sun's position, as his father had often explained
to him.</p>

<p>Dick was hungry, but scorned to let his mother
know it, and tried to dull the edge of his appetite
by chewing twigs and blades of grass.</p>

<p>After walking rapidly ten minutes, more careful
as to direction than he ever had been, because of the
responsibility that rested upon him, he stopped and
shouted his father's name; then listened, hoping to
hear a reply.</p>

<p>Save for the hum of insect life, no sound came
to his anxious ears.</p>

<p>Once more he pressed forward, and again shouted,
but without avail.</p>

<p>He continued on until, seeing the trail made by
the wagon when they had come in from the stream,
he knew he was very near to the border of the
valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>Surely his father would not have gone outside,
because he had said before they arrived that only
in the Buffalo Meadows were they likely to find
game.</p>

<p>Then Dick turned, pushing on in a northerly
direction at right angles with the course he had
just been pursuing, and halting at five-minute intervals
to shout.</p>

<p>His anxiety and hunger increased equally as the
day grew older. Try as he might, he could not
keep the tears from over-running his eyelids.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking toward the west before he
heard aught of human voice save his own; and then
a cry of joy and relief burst from his lips as he
heard faintly in the distance his own name spoken.</p>

<p>"I'm coming! I'm coming!" he cried at the
full strength of his lungs, as he dashed forward,
exultant in the thought that his father was alive,
for he had begun to believe that he would never
see him again in this world.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens continued to call out now and then
to guide the boy on the way, and as he drew nearer
Dick understood from the quavering tones that his
father was in agony.</p>

<p>"I'm coming, daddy! I'm coming!" he shouted
yet louder, as if believing it was necessary to animate
the sufferer, for he now knew that some painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
accident had befallen his father; and when he
finally ended the search his heart literally ceased
beating because of his terror and dismay.</p>

<p>Dick believed he had anticipated the worst, but
yet was unprepared for that which he saw.</p>

<p>Lying amid the blood-stained sage-grass, his shirt
stripped into bandages to tie up a grievously injured
limb, lay "Roving Dick," his face pallid, his lips
bloodless, and his general appearance that of one
whom death has nearly overtaken.</p>

<p>"Daddy! daddy!" Dick cried piteously, and then
he understood that consciousness had deserted the
wounded man.</p>

<p>He had retained possession of his faculties until
aid was near at hand, and then the long strain of
physical and mental agony had brought about a
collapse.</p>

<p>Dick raised his father's head tenderly, imploring
him to speak&mdash;to tell him what should be done;
but the injured man remained silent as if death had
interposed to give him relief.</p>

<p>Looking about scrutinizingly, as those born and
bred on the frontier learn to do early in life, Dick
saw his father's rifle twenty feet or more away,
and between it and him a trail of blood through
the sage-brush, then a sinister, crimson blotch on
the sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Mr. Stevens's right leg was the injured member,
and it had been wrapped so tightly with the improvised
bandages that the boy could form no idea as
to the extent of the wound; but he knew it must
indeed be serious to overcome so thoroughly one
who, though indolent by nature, had undergone
much more severe suffering than he could have
known since the time of leaving the wagon to
search for game.</p>

<p>It seemed to Dick as if more than ten minutes
elapsed before his father spoke, and then it was to
ask for water.</p>

<p>He might as well have begged for gold, so far as
Dick's ability to gratify the desire was concerned.</p>

<p>"To get any, daddy, I may have to go way back
to the wagon, for I haven't come upon a single
watercourse since leaving camp this morning."</p>

<p>"Your mother and Margie?"</p>

<p>"I left them at the camp. How did you get
here?"</p>

<p>"It was just before nightfall. I had been stalking
an antelope; was crawling on the ground dragging
my rifle, when the hammer must have caught
amid the sage-brush; the weapon was discharged,
and the bone of my leg appears to be shattered."</p>

<p>"Poor, poor daddy!" and Dick kissed him on
the forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>"We must be four miles from the camp," Mr.
Stevens said, speaking with difficulty because of
his parched and swollen tongue.</p>

<p>"I should say so; but I went toward the west,
and after travelling until noon struck across this
way, so have no idea of the distance."</p>

<p>"I shall die for lack of water, Dick, even though
the wound does not kill me."</p>

<p>"How shall I get it, daddy?" the boy cried
piteously. "I can't leave you here alone, and I
don't believe there's a drop nearer than where we
are camped."</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> leave me, Dick; for you can do no
good while staying here, and the thought that help
is coming, even though there may be many hours
to wait, will give me strength. Can you find your
way to the camp and back after nightfall?"</p>

<p>"I'll do it somehow, daddy! I'll do it!"</p>

<p>"Then set out at once, and bring one of the
horses back with you. I should be able to ride four
miles, or even twice that distance, since it is to
save my life."</p>

<p>"But you'll keep up a brave heart, daddy dear,
won't you? Don't think you are going to die; but
remember that mother and I, and even little
Margie, will do all we can to pull you through."</p>

<p>"I know it, Dick, I know it. You are a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
lad&mdash;far better than I have been father; and if
it should chance that when you come back I've
gone from this world, remember that you are the
only one to whom the mother and baby can look
for protection."</p>

<p>"You know I'd always take care of them; but
I am going to save you, daddy dear. People have
gotten over worse wounds than this, and once you
are at the camp we will stay in Buffalo Meadows
till it is possible for you to ride. I'll look out for
the whole outfit, and from this on you sha'n't have
a trouble, except because of the wound."</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, my boy, and now go;
for strong as may be my will, I can't stand the loss
of much more blood. God bless you, Dick, and
remember that I always loved you, even though
I never provided for you as a father should have
done."</p>

<p>Dick hastily cleared the mist from his eyes, and
without speaking darted forward in the direction
where he believed the wagon would be found, breaking
the sage-brush as he ran in order that he might
make plain the trail over which he must return.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>A LONELY VIGIL.</h3>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 75px;">
        <img src="images/i.jpg" width="75" height="77" alt="Illustrated letter I" title="Illustrated Letter I" />
</div>
<p>t was not yet dark when Dick arrived
within sight of the wagon, and shouted
cheerily that those who were so anxiously
awaiting his coming might know
he had been fortunate in the search.</p>

<p>As soon as his voice rang out, startlingly loud
because of the almost oppressive stillness, Mrs.
Stevens appeared from beneath the flap of the canvas
covering, and an expression of most intense
disappointment passed over her face as she saw
that Dick was alone.</p>

<p>"It's all right, mother!" he cried, quickening
his pace that she might the sooner be relieved from
her suspense. "It's all right!"</p>

<p>"Did you find your father?"</p>

<p>"Yes; an' I've come back for one of the horses.
He's been hurt, an' can't walk."</p>

<p>"Thank God he is alive!" she cried, and then
for the first time since the previous evening she
gave way to tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>Dick did all he could toward comforting her
without making any delay in setting out on the
return journey.</p>

<p>While he filled the canteen with fresh water he
repeated what his father had bidden him to say;
and when his mother asked concerning the wound,
he spoke as if he did not consider it serious.</p>

<p>"Of course it's bad, for he thinks one of the
bones has been splintered; but I don't see why
he shouldn't come 'round all right after a spell.
We've known of people who had worse hurts and
yet got well."</p>

<p>"But they were where at least something of
what might be needed could be procured, while we
are here in the desert."</p>

<p>"Not quite so bad as that, mother dear. We
have water, and I should be able to get food in
plenty. After I've supplied the camp, I'm goin' on
foot to Antelope Spring, where we can buy whatever
daddy may need."</p>

<p>"Across the desert alone!"</p>

<p>"A boy like me ought to be able to do it, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your father hasn't a penny, Dick dear."</p>

<p>"I know that, mother; but I'll sell my rifle before
he shall suffer for anything. Now don't worry,
and keep up a good heart till I come back."</p>

<p>"Can't I be of some assistance if I go too?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>"You'd better stay here with Margie. Father
and I can manage it alone, I reckon."</p>

<p>Then Dick set about catching one of the
horses; and as he rode the sorry-looking steed up
to the wagon, his mother gave him such articles
from her scanty store as the wounded man might
need.</p>

<p>"You're a good boy, Dick," she said, as he
stooped over to kiss her; "and some day you shall
have your reward."</p>

<p>"I'll get it now, mother, if I see you looking a
little more jolly; and indeed things ain't quite so
bad as they seem, for I can pull our little gang
through in great shape, though I'm afraid after it's
been done I sha'n't be able to get you and Margie
the new outfit I promised."</p>

<p>"We should be so thankful your father is alive
as not to realize that we need anything else."</p>

<p>"But you do, just the same, whether you realize
it or not; an' I'll attend to everything if I have
time enough. Don't trouble yourself if we're not
back much before morning, for I reckon daddy
can't stand it to ride faster than a walk."</p>

<p>Then, without daring to stop longer, lest he
should betray some sign of weakness, Dick rode
away, waving his hand to Margie, who was looking
out of the rear end of the wagon, but giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
vent to a sigh which was almost a sob when they
could no longer see him.</p>

<p>Young though he was, Dick understood full well
all the dangers which menaced. Although he had
spoken so confidently of being able to "pull the
gang through," he knew what perils were before
them during the journey across the desert; and it
must be made within a reasonably short time,
otherwise they might be overtaken by the winter
storms before arriving at their old home.</p>

<p>The beast he rode, worn by long travelling and
scanty fare, could not be forced to a rapid pace;
and when night came Dick was hardly more than
two miles from the wagon.</p>

<p>He could have walked twice the distance in that
time; but the delay was unavoidable, since only on
the horse's back could his father be brought into
camp.</p>

<p>When it was so dark that he could not see the
broken sage-brush which marked the trail, it was
necessary he should dismount, and proceed even at
a slower pace; but he continued to press forward
steadily, even though slowly, until, when it seemed
to him that the night was well-nigh spent, he heard
a sound as of moaning a short distance in advance.</p>

<p>"I've come at last, daddy. It's been a terrible
long while, I know; but it was the best I could"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>He ceased speaking very suddenly as he stood
by the side of the sufferer, whom he could dimly
see by the faint light of the stars.</p>

<p>From the broken and uprooted sage-brush around
him, it was evident the wounded man had, most
likely while in a delirium of fever, attempted to
drag himself on in the direction of the camp, and
had ceased such poor efforts only when completely
exhausted.</p>

<p>He was lying on his back, looking straight up at
the sky as he alternately moaned and talked at
random, with now and then a mirthless laugh
which frightened the boy.</p>

<p>"Don't, daddy, don't!" he begged, as he raised
the sufferer's head. "See, it's Dick come back;
and now you can ride into camp!"</p>

<p>"Mother is dying of thirst, and I'm&mdash;see that
stream! Come, boys, we'll take a header into it&mdash;I'm
on fire&mdash;fire!"</p>

<p>Frightened though he was, Dick knew water
was the one thing his father most needed; and laying
the poor head gently back on the sand, he took
the canteen from a bag which had served instead of
a saddle.</p>

<p>"Drink this, daddy, and you'll feel better," he
said coaxingly, much as if speaking to a child.</p>

<p>The wounded man seized the tin vessel eagerly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and it required all Dick's strength to prevent him
from draining it at once.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid to give you more now, my poor old
man; but wait, like a dear, and I'll let you take
it again when you're on the horse."</p>

<p>Not until after a violent struggle, which frightened
Dick because it seemed almost as if he was
raising his hand against his father, did he regain
possession of the canteen, and then a full half of
the contents had been consumed.</p>

<p>When his thirst was in a measure quenched, Mr.
Stevens lay quietly on the sand, save now and then
as he moaned in unconscious agony, heeding not
the boy's pleading words.</p>

<p>"Try to help yourself a bit, daddy," he urged.
"If you'll stand on one foot I can manage to lift
you onto the horse's back."</p>

<p>Again and again did Dick try by words to persuade
his father to do as he desired, and then he
realized how useless were his efforts.</p>

<p>He had heard of this delirium which often follows
neglect of gun-shot wounds, but had no idea
how he should set about checking it.</p>

<p>After understanding that words were useless,
and knowing full well he could not lift unaided
such a weight onto the horse's back, he crouched
by his father's side in helpless grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>Never before had he known what it was to be
afraid, however far he might be from others of his
kind; but now, as he listened to the meaningless
words, or the piteous moans, terror took possession
of him, and the soft sighing of the gentle wind
sounded in his ears like a menace.</p>

<p>The horse strayed here and there seeking food,
but he gave no heed.</p>

<p>Such garments as his mother had given him,
Dick spread over the sufferer; and that done there
was nothing for him save to wait.</p>

<p>It seemed to the anxious boy as if the night
would never end. Now and then he rose to his
feet, scanning the eastern sky in the hope of seeing
some signs of coming dawn; but the light of the
stars had not faded, and he knew the morning was
yet far away.</p>

<p>Finally, when it seemed to him as if he could
no longer remain idle listening to a strong man's
childish prattle, the eastern heavens were lighted
by a dull glow, which increased steadily until he
could see the horse feeding on the dry bunch-grass
an hundred yards away, and his long vigil was
nearly at an end.</p>

<p>His father called for water from time to time,
and Dick had given him to drink from the canteen
till no more than a cupful remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>Now he asked again, but in a voice which
sounded more familiar; and a great hope sprang up
in the boy's heart as he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's only a little left, you poor old man,
and we can't get more this side the camp. Shall
I give it to you now?"</p>

<p>"Let me moisten my lips, Dick dear. They are
parched, and my tongue is swollen until it seems
ready to burst."</p>

<p>Dick handed him the canteen; and his father
drank sparingly, in marked contrast to his greedy
swallowing of a few moments previous.</p>

<p>"It tastes sweet, my boy; and when we are at
the camp I'll need only to look at the brook in
order to get relief. Are you soon going for the
horse?"</p>

<p>"I <a name="went" id="went"></a>went, an' have got back, daddy dear. You've
been talking mighty queer&mdash;on account of the
wound, I suppose."</p>

<p>"How long have you been with me, child?"</p>

<p>"I must have got here before midnight, and the
morning is just coming now."</p>

<p>"You're a good boy, Dick."</p>

<p>"That's what mother said before I left, and between
the two of you I'm afraid you'll make me
out way beyond what I deserve. We must get
back as soon as we can, you poor old man; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
she'll be crying her eyes sore with thinking we've
both knocked under. Will we have a try at getting
on horseback?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I reckon it can be done. Lead the
beast up here, and then help me on my feet&mdash;I've
grown as weak as a baby, Dick."</p>

<p>"And I don't wonder at it. According to the
looks of this sage-brush you must have lost half of
all the blood you had at this time yesterday."</p>

<p>Now that his father was conscious once more,
all Dick's reasonless terror fled, and again he was
the manly fellow he had always shown himself
to be.</p>

<p>The horse was led to Mr. Stevens's side; and Dick
raised the nearly powerless body until, at the expense
of most severe pain, but without sign of it
by even so much as a groan, his father stood on the
uninjured limb.</p>

<p>Fortunately the horse was too weary to make
much protest at what followed; with a restive steed
it would have been impossible for the boy to half
lift, half push his father up until he was seated on
the bag that served as saddle.</p>

<p>"How is it now, you poor old man? Can you
hold on there a couple of hours?"</p>

<p>"I must, my boy; and if it so be I show signs
of losing my reason again, you must contrive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
lash me here, for unless this wound is attended to in
better shape than it is just now, I'll go under."</p>

<p>"For mother's sake you must keep a good grip
on yourself. It'll come tough, I know; but once
we're in camp you shall live on the fat of the
land."</p>

<p>Dick took up his father's rifle,&mdash;his own he had
left in the wagon when he went after the horse,&mdash;and,
leading the animal by the bridle, marched on,
glancing back every few seconds to learn how the
rider was faring.</p>

<p>Although he struggled to repress any evidence
of pain, Mr. Stevens could not prevent the agony
from being apparent on his face; and Dick, who
had neither eaten nor slept during the past twenty-four
hours, did all a boy could have done to cheer
the sufferer, without thought of his own necessities.</p>

<p>"We'll soon be in camp, daddy, when you're to
have everything you need," he said from time to
time; and then, fancying this was not sufficient
encouragement, he finally added, "you know I'm
going over to Antelope Spring to get some doctor's
stuff as soon as I've found game enough to keep
the camp supplied while I'm away."</p>

<p>"Antelope Spring!" Mr. Stevens cried, aroused
from his suffering for an instant by the bold assertion.
"You shall never do it, Dick, not if I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
twenty wounds! It's as much as a man's life is
worth to cross the desert on foot, and these horses
of ours are worse than none at all."</p>

<p>"By the time we've been in camp a couple of
weeks where the feed is good, they'll pick up in
great shape, and be fit to haul the old wagon home.
Won't it be prime to see the town once more? And
there'll be no more hunting 'round for a place
where we can get a livin' easy, eh, daddy?"</p>

<p>"No, Dickey; once we're there we'll stay, and
I'm going to turn over a new leaf if my life is
spared. I'll do more work and less loafing. But
you're not to cross the desert alone, my boy."</p>

<p>"It may be travellers will come our way, an' I
can go with them," Dick replied, taking good care
not to make any promises; for he understood from
what his mother had said that it would be absolutely
necessary that aid should be had from the
nearest settlement.</p>

<p>Fortunately, as it then seemed to the boy, the
pain which his father was enduring prevented him
from dwelling upon the subject; and as Dick
trudged on, trying to force the horse into a more
rapid gait, he turned over in his mind all he had
heard regarding such a journey.</p>

<p>There were many times when it seemed certain
Mr. Stevens must succumb to the suffering caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
by the wound; but he contrived to "keep a good
grip" on himself, as Dick had suggested, and after
what seemed the longest and most painful journey
the boy had ever experienced, the two came upon
landmarks which told they were nearing the encampment.</p>

<p>His father was ghastly pale. The big drops of
sweat on his forehead told of intense pain; and, in
order to revive his courage yet a little longer, Dick
shouted loudly to warn the dear ones who were
waiting.</p>

<p>"They'll soon come running to meet us; and you
must put on a bold front, daddy, else mother will
think you're near dead. Hold hard a little while
longer, and then we'll have you in the wagon, where
all hands of us can doctor you in great shape."</p>

<p>It is more than probable that, had he been alone,
with no one to cheer him, Mr. Stevens might never
have been able to endure the agony which must
have been his. Thanks to Dick's cheering words,
however, he not only kept his seat, but remained
conscious until his wife and son lifted him from
the horse to the bed hastily prepared in the vehicle.</p>

<p>Then nature asserted herself; and he speedily
sank into unconsciousness accompanied by delirium,
as when Dick had watched by his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>"He was just that way all night, and it frightened
me, mother. What can we do for him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Dick dear; indeed I don't. Unless
he can have proper attention death must soon
come, and I am ignorant of such nursing as he
needs. If we were only where we could call in a
doctor!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it do almost as well if we had medicine
for him?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but if we could get such things it
would also be possible to at least find out what we
should do."</p>

<p>"The horses wouldn't pull us across the desert
until after they've rested a spell," Dick said half to
himself.</p>

<p>"And even if they could, we must have food."</p>

<p>"See here, mother; you fix up daddy's leg the
best you know how, and I'll look around for something
that'll fill the pot. There are rabbits here
in plenty, though it's mighty hard luck when you
have to waste a cartridge on each one. I'll have
enough in the way of meat by the time you've
washed the wound. I've heard the poor old man
himself say that plenty of cool water was needed
on a bullet-hole."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stevens could not be hopeful under the circumstances,
for she knew better than did Dick how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
slight was the chance that the injured man could
live where it was impossible to care properly for
the wound; but she would not deprive the boy of
hope, and turned to do as he suggested.</p>

<p>Although weary and footsore, Dick did not spend
many moments in camp.</p>

<p>He waited only long enough to get his rifle and
ammunition, and then trudged off; for meat must
be had, even at the expense of cartridges, both for
the wounded man and the remainder of the family.</p>

<p>An hour later Dick returned with two rabbits;
and when these had been made ready for cooking,
he clambered into the wagon to see his father.</p>

<p>The invalid looked more comfortable, even though
nothing had been done for his relief save to cleanse
the wound, and dress it in such fashion as was possible;
but he was still in the delirium, and after
kissing the pale forehead, Dick went to where his
mother was making ready for the long-delayed meal.</p>

<p>"I don't reckon there's a bit of anything to eat,
mother?"</p>

<p>"I shall soon have these rabbits cooked."</p>

<p>"But I must be off after larger game, and don't
want to wait till dinner is ready."</p>

<p>"You need the food, Dickey, and there is only
a tiny bit of bread."</p>

<p>"Give me that, mother dear. It will stop the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
hole in my stomach for a spell, and when I come
back there'll be plenty of time to eat meat."</p>

<p>Had the circumstances been one whit less grave,
Mrs. Stevens would not have consented to his setting
out before having eaten a hearty meal; but
she knew that more meat would soon be needed,
since they had no other food, and two rabbits would
hardly provide the famishing ones with enough to
stay their hunger for the time being.</p>

<p>The piece of bread, baked the day previous from
the last of their store of flour, was brought out; and,
munching it slowly that it might seem to be more,
Dick started off again.</p>

<p>Not until nearly nightfall did he return; but he
had with him such portion of a deer's carcass as he
could drag, and all fear of starvation was banished
from camp.</p>

<p>The wounded man was resting more comfortably,
if such term can be applied properly when one is
suffering severest pain; and after hanging the meat
beneath the wagon, Dick questioned his mother as
to what might be done if they were within reach of
a physician.</p>

<p>"If we could see one, Dickey, your father's life
might be saved, for such a wound should not be
exceedingly dangerous. If I knew how to treat it,
and had the proper washes, we ought to nurse him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
back to life; but as it is, I haven't even that which
would check the fever."</p>

<p>"If you could talk to a doctor would it be all
right?"</p>

<p>"I believe so, Dickey."</p>

<p>"Would the medecine you want cost very much?"</p>

<p>"It is the same to us whether the price be much
or little, since we haven't the opportunity to get
what is needed, nor the money with which to pay
for it if a shop were near at hand."</p>

<p>Dick ceased his questioning, and set about performing
such work around the camp as might well
have been left undone until the next day.</p>

<p>A generous supply of broiled venison was made
ready, and the boy ate heartily; after which he went
into the wagon, telling his mother he would play
the part of nurse until dark, when she could take
his place.</p>

<p>Once in the vehicle, partially screened from view,
Dick, after much search for the bit of a lead-pencil
his father owned, wrote on a piece of brown paper
that had contained the last ten pounds of flour Mr.
Stevens had purchased, the following words,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,&mdash;I know you won't let me go to Antelope
Spring if I tell you about what I'm minded to do, so I shall slip
off the first thing in the morning. I'll take my rifle with me,
and by selling it, get what stuff daddy needs. I can talk with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
doctor too; and when I come back we'll fix the poor old man up
in great shape.</p>

<p>Don't worry about me, for I can get across without any bother.
I'm going to take the canteen and some slices of meat, so I sha'n't
be hungry or thirsty. I count on being back in three days; but
if I'm gone five you mustn't think anything has gone wrong, for
it may be a longer trip than I'm reckonin' on.</p>

<p>I love you, and daddy, and Margie mighty well; and this footing
it across the desert ain't half as dangerous as you think for.</p></blockquote>

<div class="signature">Your son,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><span class="smcap">Dickey.</span></div>

<p>When this had been done, he kissed his father
twice, smoothed the hair back from the pale, damp
forehead, and whispered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm going so's you'll get well, my poor old man;
and you mustn't make any kick, 'cause it's <i>got</i> to
be done."</p>

<p>Then he came out as if tired of playing the
nurse, and proposed that he sleep under the wagon
that night.</p>

<p>"With all hands inside, daddy would be crowded;
and I'm as well off out-of-doors. Kiss me, mother,
for I'm mighty tired."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>A SAND-STORM.</h3>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 75px;">
        <img src="images/i.jpg" width="75" height="77" alt="Illustrated letter I" title="Illustrated Letter I" />
</div>
<p>n this proposal to retire thus early Mrs.
Stevens saw nothing to excite her suspicions
regarding Dick's real intentions.</p>

<p>He had worked for thirty-six hours
almost incessantly; and it would not be strange if
this unusual exertion, together with the weariness
caused by excitement, had brought him to the verge
of exhaustion.</p>

<p>His mother would have insisted upon bringing
out one of the well-worn blankets, but that Dick
was decidedly opposed to taking anything from the
wagon which might in the slightest degree contribute
to his father's comfort.</p>

<p>"I'm very well off on the bare ground, and with
the wagon to shelter me from the dew I couldn't
be better fixed. Our poor old man needs all we've
got, mother; and you may be sure I won't lay
awake thinking of the feather-beds we had at
Willow Point, 'cause it's about as much as I can
do to keep my eyes open."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>"You are a dear good boy, and God will reward
you. In addition to saving your father's life, for
that is what you've done this day, you have lightened
my burden until it would be wicked to repine."</p>

<p>"I'll risk your ever doing anything very wicked,
mother; and if the time comes when it seems to
you as though I don't do exactly as you want me
to, just remember all you've said about my being
a good boy, an' let it be a stand-off, will you?"</p>

<p>"I am certain you will never do anything to
cause me sorrow, Dickey, dear. Don't get up until
you have been thoroughly rested; for now that
we have food in camp, I can do all that will be
necessary."</p>

<p>Then Dick's mother kissed him again, not leaving
him until he had stretched out at full length
under the wagon; and so tired was the boy that
Mrs. Stevens had hardly got back to take up her
duties as nurse when his loud breathing told that
he was asleep.</p>

<p>When Dick awakened it was still dark; but he
believed, because he no longer felt extremely weary,
that the night was nearly spent; and for the success
of his plan it was of the utmost importance he
should set out before his mother was astir.</p>

<p>It was his purpose to travel on foot to Antelope
Spring, a distance in an air-line of about forty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
miles, fifteen of which would be across the upper
portion of Smoke Creek Desert.</p>

<p>In this waste of sand lay all the danger of the
undertaking. The number of miles to be travelled
troubled him but little, for more than once had he
walked nearly as far in a single day while hunting;
and he proposed to spend thirty-six hours on each
stage of the journey.</p>

<p>Creeping cautiously out from under the wagon,
he fastened his letter to the flap of the canvas covering
in such a manner that his mother could not
fail to see it when she first came out; and then he
wrapped in leaves several slices of broiled venison,
after which he stowed them in his pocket.</p>

<p>The canteen was filled at a spring near-by.</p>

<p>He saw to it that his ammunition belt contained
no more than half a dozen cartridges, and then took
up his rifle, handling it almost lovingly; for this,
his only valuable possession, he intended to part
with in order to secure what might be necessary
for his father's relief and comfort.</p>

<p>The weapon was slung over his back where it
would not impede his movements; and with a single
glance backward he set out with a long, swinging
stride such as he knew by experience he could maintain
for many hours.</p>

<p>It was still dark when he had crossed the fertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
meadows, and arrived at the border of an apparently
limitless expanse of yellow sand.</p>

<p>Here it would not be possible to maintain the
pace at which he had started, because of the loose
sand in which his feet sank to the depth of an inch
at each step.</p>

<p>Having set out at such an early hour, this boy,
who was perilling his life in the hope of aiding his
father, believed the more dangerous portion of the
journey might be accomplished before the heat of
the day should be the most severe.</p>

<p>When the sun rose Dick had travelled, as nearly
as he could estimate, over three miles of desert;
and his courage increased with the knowledge that
one-fifth of the distance across the sands had already
been traversed.</p>

<p>At the end of the next hour he said to himself
that he must be nearly midway on the road of
sand; and although the labor of walking was
most severe, his heart was very light.</p>

<p>"Once across, I'll push on as fast as any fellow
can walk," he said aloud, as if the sound of his
own voice gave him cheer. "By making an extra
effort I ought to be in Antelope Spring before midnight,
and have plenty of time to sleep between
now and morning. Half a day there to sell the
rifle, an' buy what is needed, an' by sunset I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
should be at the edge of the desert again, ready
to make this part of the tramp after dark."</p>

<p>He walked quickly, and like one who intends to
go but a short distance.</p>

<p>The forty-five-mile tramp seemed to him but a
trifle as compared with what was to be gained by
the making of it.</p>

<p>He thought of his mother as she read the note
he had left on the flap of the wagon-covering, and
wondered if she looked upon his departure as an
act of disobedience, which, in fact, it was, since
both his parents had insisted he should not attempt
it.</p>

<p>Then his thoughts went out to his father, and he
told over in his mind all the questions he would
ask of the doctor at Antelope Spring; for he had no
doubt but that he should find one of that profession
there.</p>

<p>He took little heed to the monotonous view
around him, until suddenly he saw in the distance
what appeared to be a low-hanging cloud; then
he said to himself that if a shower should spring
up the sun's face would be covered, and the heat,
which was now very great, must be lessened.</p>

<p>As this cloud advanced, descending to the sands
while it rose toward the heavens, it grew more
black; and on either side were long columns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
seeming vapor rising, and as rapidly disappearing.</p>

<p>Then across the darkness on that portion of the
horizon something bright moved swiftly, as if a
flash of lightning had passed over the face of the
cloud; and in an instant the sun and the sky were
shut out from view.</p>

<p>Now the clouds took on the appearance of a
dense black fog, coming up from the southward
over the desert, until Dick was seemingly looking
at a gigantic wall, over the face of which shone
now and then bright flashes of light.</p>

<p>There was a shrieking and moaning in the air,
so it seemed to the startled boy; and he failed to
understand the meaning of this strange scene, until,
the impenetrable wall having come so near, he
could see that what appeared like flashes of light
were gigantic columns of sand springing high in
the air with fantastic shapes, and glinted by the
sun from above the apparent vapor, until they were
swallowed up in the enormous bank of cloud behind
them.</p>

<p>Then it was Dick knew the meaning of this terrible
danger which threatened him.</p>

<p>It was a storm of sand. "Dancing giants"
some have termed it, and others speak of it as the
"hot blizzard."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>As if in an instant the dancing, swirling columns
and the rushing cloud of sand, which swayed to
and fro in fantastic movements, surrounded him.</p>

<p>He was in the centre of a cyclone freighted with
particles of sand.</p>

<p>The wind roared until one might have believed
he heard the crash of thunder.</p>

<p>Dick halted, terrified, bewildered; and as he came
to a standstill, it seemed to him that the clouds on
every hand lowered until he could see the blue sky
above. Then with a shriek from the wind the very
sand beneath his feet rose and fell like billows of
the sea.</p>

<p>The tempest was upon him.</p>

<p>He shielded his eyes with his arm; but the stinging,
heated particles sought out every inch of his
body, and his clothing afforded but little protection.</p>

<p>The sand penetrated his ears and nostrils, and
burned his lips until they bled.</p>

<p>He had heard it said that to remain motionless
in such a tempest means death; for wherever the
wind meets with an obstruction, there it piles the
sand in huge mounds, and his father had told of
more than one hunter who had thus been buried
alive.</p>

<p>It was death to remain motionless, and yet to
move seemed impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>Whether he turned to the right or the left the
whirlwind struck him with a fury which it was
difficult to withstand. It was as if the wind swept
in upon him from every point of the compass&mdash;as
if he was the centre of this whirling, dancing,
blinding, murderous onrush of sand.</p>

<p>The boy's throat was dry. He was burning with
thirst.</p>

<p>The dust-laden air seemed to have literally filled
his lungs, and it was with difficulty he could
breathe.</p>

<p>Despite the protection he sought to give, his
eyes were inflamed, and the lids cruelly swollen.</p>

<p>He sank ankle-deep at every step, and above
him and around him the wild blasts shrieked, until
there were times when he feared lest he should be
thrown from his feet.</p>

<p>Pulling his hat down over his aching eyes, the
bewildered, terrified boy tried to gain some relief
from the thirst which assailed him.</p>

<p>He understood that the contents of his canteen
must be guarded jealously; for if he lived there
were still several miles of the desert journey to be
traversed, and the walking would be even more
difficult than before the storm set in, because of
the shifting sand.</p>

<p>His distress rendered him reckless; and regardless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of the future, he drank fully half the water in
the canteen, bathing his eyes with a small quantity
poured in the hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>It would have been better if he had not tried to
find relief by this last method, for the flying particles
of sand adhered to such portions of his face as
were wet, forming a coating over the skin almost
instantly.</p>

<p>He attempted to brush it off, and the gritty substance
cut into his flesh as if he had rubbed it with
emery-paper.</p>

<p>Then came into Dick's mind the thought that
he should never more see his parents on this earth,
and for the instant his courage so far deserted him
that he was on the point of flinging himself face
downward upon the sand.</p>

<p>Fortunately there appeared before his mental
vision a picture of his father lying in the wagon
with the certainty that death would come unless
his son could bring relief, and this nerved the boy
to yet greater exertion.</p>

<p>With his arms over his face, he pushed forward
once more, not knowing whether he might be retracing
his steps, or proceeding in the proper direction.</p>

<p>Every inch of advance was made against the
fierce wind and drifting sand which nearly overthrew
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>Every breath he drew was choked with dust.</p>

<p>How long he thus literally fought against the
elements it was impossible for him so much as to
conjecture.</p>

<p>He knew his strength was spending rapidly; and
when it seemed as if he could not take another
step, he stumbled, and fell against a mound of
sand.</p>

<p>It had been built by the "dancing giants" when
some obstruction had been found in the path of
the storm; and as Dick fell prostrate at the foot
of this slight elevation, there instantly came a
sense of deepest relief.</p>

<p>The sand was no longer thrown against him by
the blast; the wind had ceased to buffet him; he
was in comparative quiet, and for an instant he
failed to understand the reason.</p>

<p>Then he realized that this mound, which had
thrown him from his feet, was affording a shelter
against the tempest, which was now coming from
one direction instead of in a circle as heretofore;
and a fervent prayer of thanksgiving went up from
his heart, for he believed his life had been saved
that he might aid his father.</p>

<p>After recovering in a measure from the exhaustion
consequent upon his battle with the elements,
he proceeded with infinite care to brush the particles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of sand from his face; and this done, his
relief was yet greater.</p>

<p>Overhead the air was full of darkness; the wind
still screamed as it whirled aloft the spiral columns
of dust; the wave-like drift of the sand surged on
either side; but for the moment he was safe.</p>

<p>He had been told that such tempests were of
but short duration, and yet it seemed to him as
if already half a day had been spent in this fight
for life.</p>

<p>Then he said to himself that he could remain
where he was in safety until the wind had subsided;
but even as the words were formed in his
mind he was conscious of a weight upon his limbs
as if something was bearing him down, and for the
first time he realized that he was being rapidly
buried alive.</p>

<p>To remain where he was ten minutes longer
must be fatal; and perhaps even that length of
time would not be allowed him, for if the wind so
shifted as to cut off the top of the mound, then
he would be overwhelmed as if in a landslide.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to go into the conflict
once more; and in this second effort the odds
would be still greater against him, because his
courage was lessened.</p>

<p>He knew the danger which menaced, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
suffering he would have to endure the instant he
rose from behind the poor shelter; yet it was
necessary, and the boy staggered to his feet.</p>

<p>There was nothing to guide him in the right
direction, for all around was blackness and flying
grit; yet he believed his way lay directly in the
teeth of the storm, and because of such belief
pressed onward, resolving that he would continue
as long as was possible.</p>

<p>As he said to himself so he did, staggering this
way and that, but ever pressing forward on the
course which he believed to be the true one, blinded,
choking, bewildered by the swirling particles until
he was dimly conscious of falling, and then he
knew no more.</p>

<p>At the moment Dick fell vanquished, hardly
more than a quarter of a mile distant were two
men mounted on Indian ponies, and leading three
burros laden with a miner's outfit for prospecting.</p>

<p>To them the sand-storms of the desert were not
strange; and with the knowledge born of experience
they made preparations for "riding out the
gale," when the low, dark cloud first appeared in
the eastern horizon.</p>

<p>The animals were fastened with their heads together;
the riders bending forward in the saddles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and, as well as it could be accomplished, throwing
over all the heads a number of blankets.</p>

<p>The two horsemen had taken the precaution
while assuming this position to present their backs
to the wind, and each had tied one end of his
blanket around his waist in such manner that it
could not be stripped off by the tempest.</p>

<p>Two or three blankets were fastened to the heads
of the animals, and thus the faces of all were protected.</p>

<p>When the sand had whirled around them until
the animals were buried nearly to their bellies, the
riders forced the bunch onward ten or fifteen paces,
continuing to make this change of location at least
every five minutes during the entire time the tempest
raged; and thus it was they escaped being
buried in the downpour of sand.</p>

<p>From the time the first blast struck Dick, until
the "dancing giants" whirled away to the westward,
leaving the sky unclouded and the yellow
sands shimmering in the sunlight, no more than
thirty minutes had passed; yet in that short interval
one human life on which others depended would
have been sacrificed, unless these two travellers
who were uninjured should chance to reach that
exact spot where lay the boy partially covered by
the desert's winding-sheet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>"You can talk of a gale at sea where the sailors
are half drowned all the time; but it ain't a marker
alongside of these 'ere red-hot blizzards, eh, Parsons?"
one of the horsemen said as he threw off
the blanket from his head with a long-drawn sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>"Drownin' must be mighty pleasant kind of fun
alongside of chokin' to death on account of bein'
filled plum full with dry sand," Parsons replied.
"I allow there ain't no call for us to stay here
braggin' about our Nevada hurricanes, Tom Robinson,
more especially since we'll make less headway
now the sand has been stirred up a bit."</p>

<p>"There's nothin' to hold me here," Robinson replied
with a laugh.</p>

<p>Straightway the two men turned their ponies'
heads toward the west; and as they advanced the
patient burros, laden with a miscellaneous assortment
of goods until little else than their heads and
tails could be seen, followed steadily in the rear.</p>

<p>Five minutes after they had resumed their journey
Parsons cried, as he raised himself in the stirrups,
shading his eyes with his hands as he peered
ahead,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's that 'ere bit of blue out there? Part
of somebody's outfit? or was there a shipwreck close
at hand?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>"It's a man&mdash;most likely a tenderfoot, if he
tried to walk across this 'ere desert."</p>

<p>The two halted, and Dick Stevens's life was saved.</p>

<p>Had the storm lasted two or three minutes
longer, or these prospectors gone in any other direction,
he must have died where he had fallen.</p>

<p>Now he was dragged out from beneath the
weight of sand, and laid upon a blanket, while the
men, knowing by experience what should be done
in such cases, set about restoring the boy to consciousness.</p>

<p>Thanks to the timely attention, Dick soon opened
his eyes, stared around him for an instant in bewilderment,
and then exclaimed as he made a vain
attempt to rise,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I come pretty near knockin' under, didn't I?
The last I remember was of fallin'."</p>

<p>"I allow it was the closest shave you'll ever
have agin," Parsons replied grimly; "an' I'm free
to say that them as are sich fools as to cross this
'ere sand-barren afoot oughter stay on it, like as
you were in a fair way of doin' before we come
along."</p>

<p>"An' that's what daddy would say, I s'pose.
If he'd known what I was goin' to do, there would
have been a stop put to it, even though it was to
save his life I came."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>"How can you save anybody's life by comin'
out in sich a tom-fool way as this? Less than a
quart of water, and not so much as a blanket with
which to protect yourself."</p>

<p>"I can do it by goin' to Antelope Spring an'
findin' a doctor," Dick replied. "You see, daddy
shot himself in the leg&mdash;stove a bone all to pieces;
and mother don't know what to do, so I slid off
this mornin' without tellin' anybody."</p>

<p>"Countin' on footin' it to Antelope Spring?"
Parsons asked as if in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes; it ain't more'n forty-five miles the way
we've reckoned it."</p>

<p>"Where did you start from?"</p>

<p>"Buffalo Meadows."</p>

<p>"And when did you count on makin' that forty-five
miles?"</p>

<p>"I allowed to get there before midnight."</p>

<p>"Where's your camp?"</p>

<p>"Well, we haven't got anything you can rightly
call a camp; but we're located in a prairie schooner
near by the spring in the valley."</p>

<p>"How many in the party?"</p>

<p>"Daddy, mother, an' Margie."</p>

<p>The two men looked at Dick an instant, and
then glanced at each other, after which Parsons
said emphatically,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>"The boy has got grit; but the old man must
have been way off to come through this section of
the country in a wagon."</p>

<p>Dick explained how it was they chanced to be
travelling, and then, eager to gain all the information
possible, asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about Antelope Spring?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' good. There's a settlement by that
name; but it's a no-account place."</p>

<p>"I s'pose I'll find a doctor?"</p>

<p>"I reckon they've got somethin' of the kind
hangin' 'round. But are you countin' on draggin'
one down to Buffalo Meadows?"</p>

<p>"I don't expect to be so lucky. But mother
seemed to have the idea that if somebody who
knew all about it would tell her how to take care
of daddy's wound, she'd get along with such stuff
as I could fetch to help him out in the fever. Say,
I don't reckon either of you wants to buy a good
rifle? There ain't a better one on Humboldt
River;" and as he spoke Dick unslung the weapon
which hung at his back.</p>

<p>"What's your idea in sellin' the gun? It strikes
me, if you're countin' on pullin' through from Buffalo
Meadows to Willow Point, you'll need it."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall; but it's got to go. You see,
daddy's dead broke, an' I must have money to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
for the doctor's stuff. I don't s'pose you want it;
but if you did, here's a good chance. If you don't
buy I reckon there'll be some one up to Antelope
Spring who'll take it off my hands."</p>

<p>"Haven't you got anything else you can put up,
instead of lettin' the rifle go? In this section of
the country a tool like that will stand a man good
agin starvation."</p>

<p>"It's all I own that's worth anything, an' I'll be
mighty sorry to lose it; but she's got to go."</p>

<p>Again the men looked at the boy, then at each
other; and Parsons motioned for his companion to
follow him a short distance away, where, to Dick's
great surprise, they began an animated conversation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>AT ANTELOPE SPRING.</h3>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 75px;">
        <img src="images/d.jpg" width="75" height="77" alt="Illustrated letter D" title="Illustrated Letter D" />
</div>
<p>ick was perplexed by the behavior of
these two strangers. He failed utterly
to understand why they should have
anything of such a private nature to
discuss that it was necessary to move aside from
him; for in a few moments they would be alone
on the desert, after he had gone his way.</p>

<p>The discussion, or conversation, whichever it
may have been, did not occupy many moments;
but brief as was the time, Dick had turned to continue
his journey at the instant when the men
rejoined him.</p>

<p>"What do you allow you ought to get for that
rifle?" Parsons asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"That's what I don't know. You see, I didn't
buy it new, but traded for her before we left
home. It seems to me she ought to be a bargain
at&mdash;at&mdash;ten dollars."</p>

<p>"An' if you get the cash you're goin' to blow it
right in for what the doctor can tell you, an' sich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
stuff as he thinks your old man ought to have
eh?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'll do if it costs as much."</p>

<p>"S'posen it don't? Allow that you've got five
dollars left, what then?"</p>

<p>"I'll buy flour, an' bacon, an' somethin' for
mother an' Margie with the balance."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me your father was sich a
tenderfoot as to come down through this way without
any outfit?" Robinson asked sternly.</p>

<p>"He had plenty at the time we started; but you
see we struck bad luck all the way along, and when
we pulled into Buffalo Meadows we had cooked the
last pound of flour. There wasn't even a bit of
meat in the camp when he got shot. I knocked
over a deer last night, an' that will keep 'em goin'
till I get back."</p>

<p>"An' a kid like you is supportin' a family, eh?"
Parsons asked in a kindly tone.</p>

<p>"I don't know what kind of a fist I'm goin' to
make of it; but that's what I'll try to do till daddy
gets on his feet again. Say, how long do you
s'pose it'll take a man to get well when one leg is
knocked endways with a bullet plum through the
bone of it?"</p>

<p>"It'll be quite a bit, I'm thinkin'&mdash;too long
for you to stay in Buffalo Meadows at this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of the year. Two months ought to do it, eh, Parsons?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes; he won't get 'round any quicker
than that."</p>

<p>"I don't know as it makes much difference if he
can't walk a great deal, 'cause after the horses have
had plenty of grass for a couple of weeks we'll pull
across this place; an' once on the other side I
sha'n't worry but what I can take 'em through all
right."</p>

<p>"Look here, my son," Robinson said, as he laid his
hand on the lad's shoulder. "You've got plenty of
sand, that's a fact. I allow there ain't a kid within
a thousand miles of here that would tackle the contract
you've taken this mornin'. If we wasn't bound
to the Winnemucca Range, an it wasn't quite so
late in the season, we'd help you out by goin' down
to camp an' straightenin' things a bit; but it can't
be done now. We'll buy your rifle though, an' that's
what we've agreed on. Ten dollars ain't sich a big
pile for the gun; but yet it's plenty enough&mdash;leastways,
it's all we can afford to put out just now."</p>

<p>"I'll be mighty glad to sell it for that if you
need a rifle; an' it'll be better to make the trade
now than wait till I get into Antelope Spring,
'cause there's no dead certainty I'll find anybody
there who'll buy it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>Parsons took from a buckskin bag a small roll
of bills, and when he had counted out ten dollars
there was but little of the original amount remaining.</p>

<p>He handed the money to Dick; and the latter, after
the briefest hesitation, held the rifle toward him.</p>

<p>"Sorry to give it up, eh?" Robinson asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't when it comes to gettin' the money
for daddy; if it wasn't for that I'd be. You see,
it's the first one I ever owned, an' the way things
look now, it'll be a good while before I get another."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how we'll fix it, son. My partner
an' I ain't needin' an extra rifle just now; an' more
than as likely as not&mdash;in fact, I may say it's certain&mdash;we'll
be up 'round your way before the winter
fairly sets in. Now, if you could keep it for us till
then, it would be the biggest kind of a favor, 'cause
you see we're prospecting an' have got about all
the load the burros can tackle."</p>

<p>"You're&mdash;you're&mdash;sure you want to buy this
gun, eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, if we wasn't, there wouldn't have been
much sense in makin' the talk."</p>

<p>"But if you're prospectors, there isn't any show
of your gettin' 'round to Willow Point."</p>

<p>"Oh, we drift up an' down, here an' there, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
as the case may be. There ain't any question about
our trailin' all over the State in time, and you shall
keep the rifle in good shape till we call for it. So
long, my son. It's time for you to be hoofin' it,
if you count on gettin' to Antelope Spring this side
of to-morrow mornin'."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Parsons mounted his pony, Robinson
following the example; and in another moment
the two were on their way once more, leaving Dick
in a painful state of uncertainty regarding their purpose
in purchasing the gun.</p>

<p>During two or three minutes the boy stood where
they had left him, and then cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hello there! Hold on a minute, will you?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" and Parsons looked
over his shoulder, but neither he nor his partner
reined in their steeds.</p>

<p>"Are you buyin' this rifle? or are you makin'
believe so's to give me the ten dollars?"</p>

<p>"S'posen we was makin' believe?"</p>

<p>"Why then I wouldn't take the money, 'cause
I ain't out begging."</p>

<p>"Don't fret yourself, my son. We've bought
the gun all right; an' the next time we meet, you
can hand it over. I wish our pile had been bigger
so's we could have given twenty, 'cause a kid like
you deserves it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>The horsemen continued on, and by this time
were so far away that Dick would have been unwise
had he attempted to overtake them.</p>

<p>He stood irresolutely an instant as if doubtful of
the genuineness of this alleged business transaction.</p>

<p>It was as if the men feared he might attempt to
overtake them; for despite the heavy loads on the
burros they urged the beasts forward at their best
pace, and Dick was still revolving the matter in his
mind when they were a mile or more away.</p>

<p>"Well, it's no use for me to stand here tryin' to
figure out whether they've given me this money or
really mean to buy the rifle, for I've got to strike
Antelope Spring between this time an' midnight.
Now that there are ten dollars in my pocket, I'll
be a pretty poor stick if I don't do it; but the
sand-storm came mighty near windin' me up. It
was the toughest thing I ever saw."</p>

<p>Then Dick set forward once more, toiling over
the loose surface into which his feet sank three or
four inches at every step; and when he finally stood
on the firm soil east of this waste of shifting sand,
it was two hours past noon.</p>

<p>As he had reckoned, there were more than thirty
miles yet to be traversed; but the distance troubled
him little.</p>

<p>He had in his possession that which would buy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
such knowledge and such drugs as his father might
need, and he believed it would be almost a sin to
rebel even in his thoughts against the labor which
must be performed.</p>

<p>Now he advanced, whistling cheerily, with a
long stride and a swinging gait that should have
carried him over the trail at the rate of four miles
an hour; and not until late in the afternoon did he
permit himself to halt, and partake of the broiled
venison.</p>

<p>Then he ate every morsel, and, the meal finished,
said aloud with a low laugh of perfect content:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's lucky I didn't bring any more; for I should
eat it to a dead certainty, an' then I wouldn't be
in as good trim for walkin'. Daddy always says
that the less a fellow has in his stomach the easier
he can get over the ground, and the poor old man
never struck it truer."</p>

<p>After this halt of fifteen minutes Dick pressed
forward without more delay until he came upon
the settlement, at what time he knew not, but
to the best of his belief it was hardly more than
an hour past midnight.</p>

<p>There was no thought in his mind of spending
any portion of the money for a bed.</p>

<p>The earth offered such a resting-place as satisfied
him; and since the day his father departed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Willow Point in the hope of finding a location
where he could earn a livelihood with but little
labor, Dick had more often slept upon the ground
than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now he threw himself down by the side of a
storehouse, or shed, where he would be protected
from the night wind; and there was hardly more
than time to compose himself for rest before his
eyes were closed in slumber.</p>

<p>No person in Antelope Spring was awake at an
earlier hour next morning than Dick Stevens; for
the sun had not yet shown himself when the boy
arose to his feet, and looked around as if to say that
he was in fine condition.</p>

<p>"A tramp of forty-five miles ain't to be sneezed
at, an' when you throw in fifteen miles of desert
an' a sand-storm to boot, it's what I call a pretty
good day's work; yet I'm feelin' fine as a fiddle," he
said in a tone of satisfaction, after which he made
an apology for a toilet at the stream near-by.</p>

<p>Dick had no idea in which direction a physician
might be found; therefore he halted in front of the
first store he saw to wait until the proprietor came,
half an hour later, to attend to customers.</p>

<p>It was such a shop as one would naturally expect
to find in a settlement among the mountains
of Nevada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>From molasses to perfumery, and from ploughs
to fish-hooks, the assortment ran, until one would
say all his wants might be supplied from the stock.</p>

<p>Cheese was what Dick had decided upon for his
morning meal; and after purchasing two pounds,
together with such an amount of crackers as he
thought would be necessary, he set about eating
breakfast at the same time that he gained the
desired information.</p>

<p>"I've come from the other side of Smoke Creek
Desert," he began, speaking indistinctly because
of the fulness of his mouth, "an' want to find a
doctor."</p>

<p>"Ain't sick, are yer?" the shopkeeper asked
with mild curiosity.</p>

<p>"Daddy shot himself in the leg, an' mother
don't know what to do for him; so I've come up
to hire a doctor to tell me, an' buy whatever he
says is needed."</p>

<p>"A kid like you come across the desert! Where's
your pony?"</p>

<p>"I haven't got any. Daddy's horses are so
nearly played out that they've got to be left to
grass two or three weeks, if we count on doin' anything
with 'em."</p>

<p>"Did you walk across?" the shopkeeper asked
incredulously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>"That's what I did;" and Dick told of his sufferings
during the sand-storm, not in a boastful
way, but as if it were his purpose to give the prospectors
the praise they deserved.</p>

<p>When he had concluded, the proprietor plunged
his hands deep in his pockets, surveyed the boy
from head to foot much as Parsons and Robinson
had, saying not a word until Dick's face reddened
under the close scrutiny, when he exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be jiggered! A kid of your size&mdash;say,
how old are you, bub?"</p>

<p>"Thirteen."</p>

<p>"Well, a baby of thirteen lightin' out across
Smoke Creek Desert, an' all for the sake of helpin'
your dad, eh? Do you reckon you can bite out
of Dr. Manter's ear all you want to know, an' then
go back an' run the business?"</p>

<p>"It seems as if he ought to tell me what mother
needs to do, an' I can remember every word. Then
she said there would have to be some medicine to
stop the fever; an' that's what I'm countin' on
buyin', if he gives me the name of it."</p>

<p>"When are you goin' back?"</p>

<p>"I'm in hopes to get away this noon, an' then
I'll be in camp by to-morrow mornin'."</p>

<p>"Say, sonny, do you want to stuff me with the
yarn that you've travelled forty-five miles in less'n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
thirty-six hours, an' count on doin' the same thing
right over agin, which is ninety miles in less'n
three days?"</p>

<p>"I've done the first half of the journey, an' it
couldn't have been more'n two hours past midnight
when I got here. With such a lay-out as
this for breakfast I'll be in good shape for goin'
back; an' it would be a mighty poor boy who
couldn't get there between this noon an' to-morrow
mornin', 'cause I'll go across the desert after dark,
an' it ain't likely there'll be another sand-storm."</p>

<p>"Well, look here, sonny, stand right there for
a minute, will you, while I go out? I won't be
gone a great while, an' you can finish up your
breakfast."</p>

<p>"But I want to see the doctor as soon as I can,
you know."</p>

<p>"That'll be all right. I'll make it in my way to
help you along so you sha'n't be kept in this town
a single hour more'n 's necessary."</p>

<p>Having said this, and without waiting to learn
whether his young and early customer was willing
to do as he had requested, the proprietor of the
store hurriedly left the building, and Dick had
finished his meal before he returned.</p>

<p>The boy was stowing the remainder of the cheese
and crackers into his pockets when the shopkeeper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
accompanied by two men, who looked as if they
might have been hunters or miners, entered.</p>

<p>"Is this the kid?" one of the strangers asked,
looking as curiously at the boy as had the proprietor.</p>

<p>"That's the one; an' the yarn he tells must be
pretty nigh true, 'cause he met Parsons an' Robinson,
an' accordin' to his story they bought his rifle,
leavin' it with him till such time as they want to
claim it."</p>

<p>The newcomers questioned Dick so closely regarding
the journey and its purpose that he
began to fear something was wrong, and asked
nervously,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's the reason I shouldn't have come up
here? When a feller's father is goin' to die if he
can't get a doctor afoul of him, it's a case of hustlin'
right sharp."</p>

<p>"An' accordin' to the account you've given,
that's about what you've been doin'," one of the
strangers said with an approving nod, which reassured
the boy to such an extent that he answered
without hesitation the further questions which
were asked.</p>

<p>When the curiosity of the men had been satisfied,
one of those whom the landlord had brought in,
and who was addressed by his companions as "Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Mason," said to Dick, as he laid his hand on the
boy's shoulder,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We'll take care of you, my bold kid, an' see
that you get all your father needs. If it wasn't
that the doctor in this 'ere town is worked mighty
hard, I'd make it my business to send him right
down to your camp. But I reckon, if it's nothin'
more'n a bullet through your dad's leg, he'll pull
'round all right with sich things as you can carry
from here. Now come on, an' we'll find out what
the pill-master thinks of the case."</p>

<p>Dick was thoroughly surprised that so much
interest in his affairs should be manifested by
strangers, and it pleased him that he was to have
assistance in this search for medical knowledge.</p>

<p>He followed this new friend readily, and in a few
moments was standing before the doctor, listening
to Mr. Mason's highly colored version of the
journey.</p>

<p>When he would have corrected the gentleman as
to some of the points which had been exaggerated,
he was kindly bade to "hold his tongue."</p>

<p>"I've heard all your yarn, my boy, an' can imagine
a good many things you didn't tell. There's
precious few of us in this section of the country
that was ever overtook, while on foot, by the
dancin' giants, an' lived to tell the story."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>"I wouldn't be alive if it hadn't been for Mr.
Parsons an' Mr. Robinson."</p>

<p>"What they did don't cut any figger. It's what
you went through with that I'm talkin' about, an'
the doctor is bound to hear the whole story before
he gives up what he knows."</p>

<p>Not until Mr. Mason had concluded the recital
after his own fashion did he give the professional
gentleman an opportunity to impart the information
which Dick had worked so hard to obtain;
and then the physician, after telling him in a
general way how the patient should be treated,
wrote out in detail instructions for Mrs. Stevens
to follow.</p>

<p>Then from his store of drugs, pills, and nauseous
potions he selected such as might be needed in the
case, writing on each package full directions, at the
expense of at least an hour's time; and when he
had finished, Dick believed that his father would
suffer for nothing in the way of medicine.</p>

<p>"There, lad," Dr. Manter said as he concluded
his labors, and tied in the smallest possible compass
the articles he had set out, "I allow your mother
should be able to do all that is necessary; and unless
the bone is so shattered that the leg must be amputated,
it is possible you will get along as well without
a physician as with one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>"Do you mean there's a chance my poor old
man might have to let his leg be cut off?"</p>

<p>"If you have described the wound correctly, I
should say there was every danger. I have written,
however, to your mother, so that she may be able
to decide if anything of the kind is probable, and
then you may be obliged to make another journey
up here. At all events, if your father's life should
be in danger, you may depend upon it I will come
to the camp; although I am free to admit that a
ride across Smoke Creek Desert isn't one that I
hanker for, although you seem to have made the
journey on foot and thought little of it."</p>

<p>"That's 'cause I was doin' it on daddy's account.
How much is your price for this stuff?"</p>

<p>Mr. Mason instantly plunged his hand in his
pocket; and before he could withdraw it the physician
replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have earned all I've given you, lad; and
I'd be ashamed to take even a dollar from a plucky
little shaver like you."</p>

<p>"But I've got ten dollars, an' can pay my way.
If I'd thought the prospectors meant to give me
the money instead of buyin' the rifle, I'd got along
without it; but they said twice over that they
wanted the gun, an' I believed 'em."</p>

<p>"No one can accuse you of being a beggar; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
if it's the same to you, I'd rather let this go on
account, and some day perhaps, when you've
struck it rich, come around and we'll have a
settlement."</p>

<p>"Doctor, you're a man, every inch of you!" Mr.
Mason said in a loud tone, as he slapped the physician
on the shoulder with a force that caused him
to wince with absolute pain. "You're a man; an'
if the people in this town don't know it already,
they shall find it out from yours truly. I reckon
we can ante up a little something in this 'ere
matter, so the kid won't go home empty-handed;
for I tell you there's nothin' in Antelope Spring
too good for him."</p>

<p>Again Dick looked about him in surprise that
such praise should be bestowed for what seemed
to him a very simple act. The kindly manner in
which the physician bade him good-by, with the
assurance that he would himself go to Buffalo
Meadows if it should become necessary, served to
increase the boy's astonishment; and instead of
thanking the gentleman, he could only say, because
of his bewilderment,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I did it for daddy, sir; an' it would be a mean
kind of fellow who wouldn't do as much."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Mason hurried him away, and despite
Dick's protests insisted on leading him from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
place to another, until it was as if he had been introduced
to every citizen in the settlement.</p>

<p>He was not called upon to tell his story again,
because his conductor did that for him; and the
details of the narrative were magnified with each
repetition, until Dick believed it absolutely necessary
he should contradict certain portions wherein
he was depicted as a hero of the first class.</p>

<p>When Mr. Mason had shown the boy fully around
the town, he said by way of parting,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now you go down to Mansfield's, an' wait
there till I come."</p>

<p>"Where's Mansfield's?"</p>

<p>"That's the store where I found you."</p>

<p>"But I can't wait a great while, Mr. Mason.
You know I've got to be back by to-morrow mornin';
an' I ought to be leavin' now, 'cause it's pretty
near noon."</p>

<p>"Don't worry your head about that, my son.
You shall get to camp before sunrise to-morrow
mornin', an' without so very much work on your
part, either. Now go down to Mansfield's, an' wait
there till I come. Mind you don't leave this town
till I'm back there."</p>

<p>Mr. Mason hurried away as he ceased speaking;
and Dick walked slowly down the street, debating
in his mind whether he must obey this order.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>DICK "PULLS THROUGH."</h3>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 75px;">
       <img src="images/w.jpg" width="75" height="74" alt="Illustrated letter W" title="Illustrated Letter W" />
</div>
<p>hen Dick had retraced his steps to Mansfield's
he found no less than ten of the
citizens there, several of whom he had
already met; and all were evidently
eager to talk with the boy who had walked across
Smoke Creek Desert.</p>

<p>There were but few in that section of the country
who would have dared to make the venture,
although it was by no means a dangerous or difficult
journey for a horseman; and Dick's bravery,
in connection with all the circumstances, pleased
the citizens of Antelope Spring wonderfully well.</p>

<p>The package Dick carried told that he had been
successful in finding a physician, and Mr. Mansfield
was curious to learn how much the medical gentleman
had charged for his services.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't take a cent," Dick said in reply to
the question. "It seems to me the folks in this
town are mighty good."</p>

<p>"I don't reckon we'll ever be hung for our goodness,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the proprietor of the shop said with a grin;
"but it is considerable of a treat to see a kid with
so much sand as you've shown. Dr. Manter knew
which side his bread was buttered on when he
wouldn't take your money; an' if your father don't
get better with what you're takin' to him, you can
count on Manter seein' the thing through. You've
got quite a load, my son."</p>

<p>"Yes; an' I'm countin' on carryin' more, if you'll
take money for what I buy. I don't want to set
myself up for a beggar, 'cause I've got the stuff to
pay for everything."</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"About ten pounds of flour, and the same weight
in bacon or salt pork, with a little pepper and salt,
will be as much as I can carry."</p>

<p>"It's a good deal more'n I'd want to tote forty-five
miles 'twixt now and sunset," one of the visitors
remarked; and Dick replied cheerily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It wouldn't seem very heavy if you was carryin'
it to your folks who'd had nothin' but fresh
meat to eat for the last month. Mother and Margie
will be wild when I bring in that much."</p>

<p>"I'll put up twenty-five pounds in all, for I reckon
there are other things that would come handy,"
Mr. Mansfield said as he began to weigh out the
articles, and Dick asked quickly,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>"You're to let me pay for 'em?"</p>

<p>"Sure," the proprietor replied as he winked at
the loungers. "You shall give all the stuff is
worth."</p>

<p>"I didn't want to hang 'round here very long;
but Mr. Mason said I was to wait for him."</p>

<p>"If Bob Mason give sich orders it'll be worth
your while to stop a spell; for he's as cross-grained
as a broncho when matters don't go to
his likin', an' might make trouble for you."</p>

<p>Dick was considerably disturbed by this remark,
which had much the sound of a threat, and looked
out of the door uneasily.</p>

<p>The citizens had been exceedingly kind to him;
but he had had no little experience with inhabitants
of frontier towns, and knew that friendship
might be changed to enmity very suddenly.</p>

<p>The shopkeeper had not finished filling the small
order when Bob Mason rode up on a wiry-looking
broncho, and after tying the beast to a hitching-post,
entered the store.</p>

<p>"I had an idea that was what you were up to,"
one of the loungers said; and Mason replied with
a laugh,&mdash;</p>

<p>"When we have sich a visitor as this 'ere kid, I
reckon we're called on to make things pleasant for
him." Then turning to Dick he added, "If it so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
be your daddy pulls through all right for the next
week or ten days, he should be in condition to ride
this far?"</p>

<p>"After the horses have rested a little I counted
on starting for Willow Point."</p>

<p>"It strikes me that would be too rough a journey
for the old man at this time of the year. We're
needin' kids like you in this town, an' I allow
you'll find a shelter here till spring. Then, if the
settlement don't suit you, it'll be only a case of
goin' on when the travellin' is easier."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that we'd better live here?"
Dick asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"That's the way some of us have figgered it."</p>

<p>"Can I find work enough to pay our way? You
see, daddy won't be in shape to do anything for
quite a spell."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a job on my ranch, an' pay fair
wages."</p>

<p>"Then we'll be glad to stop."</p>

<p>"All right, my son. You shall take your own
time about comin', and I'll hold the job open till
you get here. Now I'm allowin' to lend you that
broncho, so you can get back in case the old man
grows worse. He's a tricky beast; but I reckon
you'll handle him without any too much trouble.
The only drawback is that I can't furnish a saddle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>"If you can spare the pony, I'll get along without
the fixings," Dick replied, his eyes gleaming
with delight; for with such a steed he would be
able to visit the town at short notice, if it should
become necessary.</p>

<p>"I'm allowin' that I've got a saddle he can have
for a spell," Mr. Mansfield replied thoughtfully;
and although Dick insisted that there was really
no need of one, it was brought out.</p>

<p>The loungers took it upon themselves to see that
the broncho was properly harnessed; and now that
it was no longer necessary to limit the weight of
the supplies, the shopkeeper suggested that the
amount of flour and bacon be doubled.</p>

<p>"Will ten dollars be enough to pay for it?"
Dick asked.</p>

<p>"We'll make a charge of it, seein's you're goin'
to work for Bob Mason. You can give me an
order on him after you've been here a spell, an'
it'll be the same thing as cash."</p>

<p>"Now you're doin' the square thing, Mansfield,"
Mason said approvingly; and despite Dick's protests
that he preferred to pay his way so long as
he had the money, the matter was thus arranged.</p>

<p>"You are sure I can earn enough to pay for
what we'll need to eat between now and spring?"
the boy asked doubtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>"I'm allowing from what I've seen, that you'll
earn a man's wages, an' that'll be thirty dollars a
month. If your father is anything like you, I'll
guarantee he can find work enough to support the
family; an' Antelope Spring is needin' settlers
mighty bad."</p>

<p>The supply of provisions and the medicines were
packed in a bag, divided into two portions of equal
weight that they might be carried over the saddle,
and then Dick was ready to mount.</p>

<p>He realized fully how kind the people of the
town had been to him, and was eager to say that
which should give token of the gratitude in his
heart; but the words refused to come at his
bidding.</p>

<p>He stammered in the attempt to speak, cleared
his throat nervously, and tried again,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You've been mighty good, all hands, an' I'm
thinkin' it'll help daddy pull through. I wish&mdash;I
wish"&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's all right, my son," Bob Mason interrupted.
"We've got a good idea of what you
want to say, an' you can let it go at that. As
a general thing we don't get stuck on kids; but
when one flashes up in the style you have, we
cotton to him mightily. You can push that 'ere
broncho right along, for forty-five miles ain't any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
terrible big job for him, an' canter into camp this
side of midnight with considerable time to spare."</p>

<p>"I thank you all, an' so will mother an' daddy
when they get here," he said in a husky tone, as
he mounted; and then waving his cap by way of
adieu, he rode away, the happiest boy to be found
on either side of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Night had not fully come when he halted at the
eastern edge of the desert to give the broncho
water and grass; and here he remained an hour,
the crackers and cheese left from breakfast affording
an appetizing supper to a lad who had known
but little variation in his bill of fare from fresh
meat, broiled or stewed, more often without salt or
pepper.</p>

<p>The stars guided him on the course across the
waste of sand, and the pony made his way over
the yielding surface at a pace which surprised the
rider.</p>

<p>"He can walk four miles an hour, according to
this showing, and I should be in camp before ten
o'clock."</p>

<p>In this he was not mistaken. The broncho
pushed ahead rapidly, proving that he had traversed
deserts before, and was eager to complete the
journey; and when Dick came within sight of
the wagon, his mother was standing in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the camp-fire, so intent on broiling a slice of venison
that she was ignorant of his coming until he
shouted cheerily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here I am, mother dear, coming along with
a good bit of style, and so many fine things that
you'll open your eyes mighty wide when this bag
is emptied. How is my poor old man?"</p>

<p>He had dismounted as he ceased speaking, and
was instantly clasped in his mother's arms.</p>

<p>"O Dick, Dick, how sore my heart has been!
Your father said you could not get across the desert
on foot, and I have pictured you lying on the sands
dying."</p>

<p>"You've made your pictures all wrong, dearie;
for here I am in prime condition, and loaded down
with good things. The people up at Antelope
Spring have shown themselves to be mighty generous.
How is daddy?"</p>

<p>"He is resting comfortably just now, although
he has suffered considerable pain. Did you see a
doctor?"</p>

<p>"Yes; an' am loaded way up to the muzzle with
directions as to what must be done. Let's go in
and see the poor old man, an' then I'll tell you
both the story."</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens's voice was heard from the inside of
the wagon as he spoke Dick's name; Margie clambered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
out, her big brown eyes heavy with slumber,
to greet her brother, and the boy was forced to
receive her caresses before it was possible to care
for the broncho.</p>

<p>Then, as soon as might be, Dick entered the
wagon, and the hand-clasp from his father was
sufficient reward for all his sufferings in the desert.</p>

<p>It was midnight before he finished telling of
his journey, and reception by the men of Antelope
Spring.</p>

<p>He would have kept secret the peril which came
to him with the sand-storm; but his father questioned
him so closely that it became necessary to
go into all the details, and more than once before
the tale was concluded did his mother press him
lovingly to her as she wiped the tears from her
eyes.</p>

<p>"You mustn't cry now it is all over," he said
with a smile, as he returned the warm pressure of
her hand. "I'm none the worse for havin' been
half buried, an' we're rich. I'm countin' on pullin'
out of here as soon as the horses are in condition;
an' we'll stay at the town till spring&mdash;perhaps
longer."</p>

<p>Although he claimed that he was not hungry,
his mother insisted on preparing supper from the
seemingly ample store of provisions; and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
meal had been eaten it was so nearly morning that
Dick would have dispensed with the formality of
going to bed, but that his mother declared it was
necessary he should gain some rest.</p>

<p>His heart was filled with thankfulness when he
lay down under the wagon again, covered with a
blanket; and perhaps for the first time in his life
Dick did more than repeat the prayer his mother
taught him, for he whispered very softly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You've been mighty good to me, God, an' I
hope you're goin' to let my poor old man have
another whack at livin'."</p>

<p>Dick had repeated to his mother all the instructions
given him by the physician, and before he
was awake next morning Mrs. Stevens set about
dressing the wound in a more thorough manner
than had ever been possible before.</p>

<p>She was yet engaged in this task when the boy
opened his eyes, and learning to his surprise that
the day was at least an hour old, sprang to his feet
like one who has been guilty of an indiscretion.</p>

<p>"What! up already?" he cried in surprise, as
looking through the flap of the wagon-covering, he
saw what his mother was doing.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dick dear, and I have good news for you.
Both your father and I now think he was mistaken
in believing the bone was shattered by the bullet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Perhaps it is splintered some, but nothing more
serious."</p>

<p>"Then you won't be obliged to have it cut off,
daddy, an' should be able to get round right soon."</p>

<p>"There's this much certain, Dick, whether the
bone is injured or not, my life has been saved
through your efforts; for I know enough about
gun-shot wounds to understand that I couldn't
have pulled through without something more than
we were able to get here."</p>

<p>"Yet you would have prevented me from leaving
if I had told you what was in my mind."</p>

<p>"I should for a fact; because if one of us two
must go under, it would be best for mother an'
Margie that I was that one."</p>

<p>"Why, daddy! you have no right to talk like
that!"</p>

<p>"It's true, Dick. I've been a sort of ne'er-do-well,
otherwise I wouldn't have been called Roving
Dick, while you are really the head of the house."</p>

<p>"I won't listen to such talk, daddy; for it sounds
as if you were out of your head again, as when we
were alone that night. You'll perk up after we're
at Antelope Spring, an' show the people there what
you can do."</p>

<p>"I shall be obliged to work very hard in order
to make a good showing by the side of you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>Dick hurried away, for it pained him to hear his
father talk in such fashion; yet at the same time he
hoped most fervently that there would be no more
roaming in search of a place where the least possible
amount of labor was necessary, and it really
seemed as if "Roving Dick" had made up his
mind to lead a different life.</p>

<p>There was little opportunity for the boy to remain
idle.</p>

<p>The supplies he had brought from Mr. Mansfield's
shop would not suffice to provide the family
with food many days unless it was re-enforced by
fresh meat; and as soon as Dick had seen to it that
the horses and the broncho were safe, he made
preparations for a hunting-trip.</p>

<p>When breakfast had been eaten, and how delicious
was the taste of bacon and flour-bread to this
little party, which had been deprived of such food
so long, he started off, returning at night-fall with
a small deer and half a dozen rabbits.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the venison he cut up
ready for smoking; and when his mother asked
why he was planning so much labor for himself, he
replied cheerily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We're likely to lay here ten days at the very
least, for the horses won't be in condition to travel
in much less time; and now is my chance to put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
a stock of provisions for the winter. It never'll
do to spend all my wages for food; because you
and Margie are to be fitted out in proper shape,
and now I haven't even the rifle to sell, for that
belongs to the prospectors."</p>

<p>Not an idle hour did Dick Stevens spend during
the time they remained encamped at Buffalo Meadows;
and when the time came that his father believed
they might safely begin the journey to
Antelope Spring, he had such a supply of smoked
meat as would keep the family in food many
days.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens's wound had healed with reasonable
rapidity, thanks to the materials for its dressing
which Dick had risked his life to procure; and on
the morning they decided to cross the desert the
invalid was able to take his place on the front
seat of the wagon to play the part of driver.</p>

<p>Dick rode the broncho, as a matter of course;
and to him this journey was most enjoyable.</p>

<p>Not until the second day did the family arrive
at their destination, and Dick received such a reception
as caused his cheeks to redden with joy.</p>

<p>Bob Mason chanced to be in front of Mansfield's
store when the party rode up, and insisted on their
remaining there until he could summon the inhabitants
of the settlement to give them welcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>"We're glad you've come," Mr. Mason said when
he believed the time had come for him to make a
speech. "We've seen the kid, an' know how much
sand he's got; so if the rest of the family are anything
like him, and I reckon they must be, we're
gettin' the kind of citizens we hanker after. I've
pre-empted the boy, an' allow he'll look out for
things on the ranch as well as any man I could
hire, an' a good deal better'n the average run.
We've got a house here for the rest of you, an'
Stevens will find plenty of work if he's handy with
tools. Now then, kid, we'll get the old folks
settled, an' after that I'll yank you off with
me."</p>

<p>Mason led the way to a rude shanty of boards,
which was neither the best nor the worst dwelling
in the town; and to Mrs. Stevens and Margie it
seemed much like a palace, for it was a place they
could call home, a pleasure they had not enjoyed
since leaving Willow Point two years ago.</p>

<p>Dick observed with satisfaction that there was a
sufficient amount of furniture in the shanty to
serve his parents until money could be earned with
which to purchase more; and then he rode away
with Bob Mason, leading the team-horses to that
gentleman's corral.</p>

<p>He had brought his family to a home, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
before him a good prospect of supplying them with
food, even though his father should not be able to
do any work until the coming spring; therefore
Dick Stevens was a very happy boy.</p>

<p>Here we will leave him; for he is yet in Mason's
employ, and it is said in Antelope Spring to-day,
or was a few months ago, that when "Bob Mason
hired that kid to oversee his ranch, he knew what
he was about."</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that a boy only fifteen years
of age (for Dick has <i>now</i> been an overseer, or "boss
puncher" as it is termed in Nevada, nearly two
years) could care for a ranch of six hundred acres;
yet he has done it, as more than one can testify,
and in such a satisfactory manner that next year
he is to have an interest in the herds and flocks on
the "Mason Place."</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens recovered from the wound in due
time; and early in the spring after his arrival at
the settlement, he joined Messrs. Parsons &amp; Robinson
in prospecting among the ranges.</p>

<p>His good fortune was even greater than Dick's;
for before the winter came again the firm had
struck a rich lead of silver, which has been worked
with such profit that "Roving Dick's" home is
one of the best and the cosiest to be found in the
State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Mr. Stevens would have been glad had young
Dick decided to give up his work on the ranch; but
the latter has declared again and again that he
will leave mining strictly alone, because "cattle
are good enough for him."</p>
